💡 Inspiration for future personal UI library: Orbit

<br>
📚 Inspired By
This project is built as part of my journey to master UI building.
I’m also working on a lightweight custom HTML-CSS-JS UI component library called Orbit 🚀 —
something that will help others build fast without relying on big frameworks.

💬 Final Words
If you ever told someone like me —

"You learned this in your sleep?" 😴

Remember, this was built with 1000+ hours of deep focus, not shortcuts.
Every section, every class, every pixel — written by hand.

💥 Stay tuned for Orbit, the framework that will save hours of work for others, just like Bootstrap does —
but simpler, cleaner, and developer-first.
